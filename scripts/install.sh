# Deploy src/module.json as it stands — the version in the tree IS the
# version that lands on the Move.
#
# That only works because of the rebuild check above: this script used to
# copy dist/module.json, and dist/ was rebuilt only when the .so was
# MISSING, so a version bump alone left the old number in place. A Move
# ran the 0.4.0 code and reported "0.3.3" in Schwung Manager for a day.
#
# There was briefly a "0.0.0-dev+<version>-g<sha>" stamp here to make a
# hand-deploy unmistakable. It was correct and unreadable. Bump the patch
# version when you deploy a change instead — an ordinary version number
# people can say out loud.
#
# The one thing to keep in mind: a version deployed by hand and never
# tagged sits ABOVE the catalog, so Schwung Manager offers no update and
# the device quietly stays on an unreleased build. Tag what you deploy.

# whenever the module sits in a chain slot — so the file backing a live
# mapping is truncated under it and the next page fault executes garbage.
# That is a hard SIGSEGV in the shim, taking Move's whole audio process
# down with it; it took three of them, one per upload, to spot the
# pattern (debug.log, 2026-08-27).
#
# rename(2) is atomic and gives the new file its own inode, so a running
# instance keeps its old mapping intact and simply carries on with the old
# code until the module is next loaded. Temp file goes in the SAME
# directory, or the rename becomes a copy and the guarantee is lost.

# new file its own inode, so the process keeps executing the old one — from
# a file that no longer has a name.
#
# That is not theoretical: a Move sat on the previous build through FOUR
# deploys, reporting the new version in module.json (which is just a file)
# while running the old code, with 8 (deleted) regions in its maps. The
# advice printed here at the time — "swap the slot away and back" — did not
# take. So the script now reloads by default and, more importantly, REFUSES
# TO CLAIM SUCCESS until the mapped inode matches the one on disk.
#
# --no-reload skips it, for when you are mid-take and will restart later.
